    "## __*Motivation for Dataset Creation:*__\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why was the dataset created? (e.g., were there specific tasks in mind, or a specific gap that needed to be filled?)\n",
    "\tVAERS, Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, was established to be a national early warning system to detect possible safety problems in U.S. licensed vaccines. The system accepts and analyzes reports of adverse events and possible side effects after vaccination has occurred. It was initially established in 1990 as a response to the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### \tObjectives via VAERS website: \n",
    "•\tDetect new, unusual, or rare vaccine adverse events;\n",
    "•\tMonitor increases in known adverse events;\n",
    "•\tIdentify potential patient risk factors for particular types of adverse events;\n",
    "•\tAssess the safety of newly licensed vaccines;\n",
    "•\tDetermine and address possible reporting clusters (e.g., suspected localized [temporally or geographically] or product-/batch-/lot-specific adverse event reporting);\n",
    "•\tRecognize persistent safe-use problems and administration errors;\n",
    "•\tProvide a national safety monitoring system that extends to the entire general population for response to public health emergencies, such as a large-scale pandemic influenza vaccination program.\n",
    "### What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for? Are there obvious tasks for which it should not be used?\n",
    "\tAn obvious task that VAERS should not be used for is for the purpose of providing medical advice. This dataset can be used to do a retrospective analysis or an investigative analysis of different variables that can infer from year to year what has been the trend in vaccination formulation and if there is any correlation between the side effects. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the website itself: “VAERS is not designed to determine if a vaccine caused a health problem but is especially useful for detecting unusual or unexpected patterns of adverse event reporting that might indicate a possible safety problem with a vaccine.”\n",
    "\n",
    "### Has the dataset been used for any tasks already? If so, where are the results so others can compare (e.g., links to published papers)?\n",
    "\tIt has been used in numerous academic publications that focus on vaccination safety and monitoring. This website links to academic papers by dataset year: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/publications.html\n",
    "\n",
    "### Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, provide the grant number.\n",
    "\tVAERS was created and is being co-managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention along with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, agencies of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. \n",
    "\n",
    "## __*Dataset Composition:*__\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are the instances? (that is, examples; e.g., documents, images, people, countries) Are there multiple types of instances? (e.g., movies, users, ratings; people, interactions between them; nodes, edges) \n",
    "\tThe instances are the people who have reported events through the VAERS system. Anyone can report to the database. Health professionals, patients, parents, caregivers, etc. Their names are de-identified once reported. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Are relationships between instances made explicit in the data (e.g., social network links, user/movie ratings, etc.)? \n",
    "\tThere are no known relationships between instances besides the fact they are all individuals who willingly reported after a vaccination event. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How many instances of each type are there? \n",
    "What are the instances? (that is, examples; e.g., documents, images, people, countries) Are there multiple types of instances? (e.g., movies, users, ratings; people, interactions between them; nodes, edges) \n",
    "\tThere are 44,504 instances. Unknown currently if an individual reported more than once as each reported event is given its own unique VAERS ID number. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What data does each insistence consist of? \n",
    "\tConsists of raw data collected from fields that instances would input once a event occurred. Data includes demographic information, type of vaccination, classification, and narratives of adverse symptoms and the resulting measures taken. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Is everything included or does the data rely on external resources? \n",
    "\tSince VAERS is a passive reporting system, it means that it relies on individuals to send in reports of their experiences to the CDC and FDA. Therefore, this data does not collect all vaccination events across the U.S., adverse event or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Are there recommended data splits or evaluation measures? \n",
    "\tUnknown\n",
    "\n",
    "### What experiments were initially run on this dataset? \n",
    "\tUnknown if experiments were initially ran on the database, however since, the data set has been used to test different hypothesis on regulation and safety monitoring in regards to vaccination and its trends. \n",
    "\n",
    "## __*Data Collection Process:*__ \n",
    "\n",
    "### How was the data collected? (e.g., hardware apparatus/sensor, manual human curation, software program, software interface/API; how were these constructs/measures/methods validated?)\n",
    "\thttps://vaers.hhs.gov/data/datasets.html\n",
    "\tData was collected from the VAERS online self-reporting portal. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Who was involved in the data collection process?\n",
    "\tUnknown. Since data is self-reported, it is unknown who and how it was originally initiated (ex. private clinic reporting, large hospital, call to CDC, etc). \n",
    "\t\n",
    "### Over what time-frame was the data collected? \n",
    "\tData has been collected each year since 1990, however, not all years seem completed. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How was the data associated with each instance acquired? \n",
    "\tThrough survey linked on the CDC website. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Does the dataset contain all possible instances? Or is it, for instance, a sample (not necessarily random) from a larger set of instances? \n",
    "\tDoes not contain all possible instances. Unreporting is an issue. \n",
    "\n",
    "### If the dataset is a sample, then what is the population? What was the sampling strategy (e.g., deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)? Is the sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geo- graphic coverage)? If not, why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range of instances)? How does this affect possible uses? \n",
    "\tUnknown. Since it is self-reporting, we cannot determine how representative the set is. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Is there information missing from the dataset and why? (this does not include intentionally dropped instances; it might include, e.g., redacted text, withheld documents) Is this data missing because it was unavailable? \n",
    "\tYes, it does not include instances when no adverse event has occurred. It also does not contain all the vaccines where an adverse event has occurred since this is self-reported and not required to be completed by a medical professional or patient. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Are there any known errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the data? \n",
    "\tUnknown. \n",
    "\n",
    "## __*Data Preprocessing:*__ \n",
    "\n",
    "### What preprocessing/cleaning was done? \n",
    "\tUnknown. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned data? (e.g., to support unanticipated future uses)\n",
    "\tUnknown. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Is the preprocessing software available? \n",
    "\tUnknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Does this dataset collection/processing procedure achieve the motivation for creating the dataset stated in the first section of this datasheet?\n",
    "\tThere are potential limitations to the dataset which might bias the data towards a particular demographic or event. \n",
    "\n",
    "## __*Data Distribution:*__\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is the dataset distributed? (e.g., website, API, etc.; does the data have a DOI; is it archived redundantly?)\n",
    "\tCan be downloaded from https://vaers.hhs.gov/data.html in raw data in CVS files. \n",
    "\n",
    "### When will the dataset be released/first distributed? \n",
    "\tThis particular database for 2015 reporting was released on  July 2016. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What license (if any) is it distributed under? Are there any copyrights on the data?\n",
    "\tVAERS is in the public domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What license (if any) is it distributed under? Are there any copyrights on the data? \n",
    "Are there any fees or access/export restrictions? \n",
    "\tNo. \n",
    "\n",
    "## __*Dataset Maintenance:*__\n",
    "\n",
    "### Who is supporting/hosting/maintaining the dataset? How does one contact the owner/curator/manager of the dataset (e.g. email address, or other contact info)?\n",
    "\tVAERS is co-sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), agencies of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Will the dataset be updated? How often and by whom? How will up- dates/revisions be documented (e.g., mailing list, GitHub)? Is there an erratum?\n",
    "\tUnknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "### If the dataset becomes obsolete how will this be communicated? \n",
    "\tUnknown. Mostly likely announced in a press release by the CDC and FDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### If others want to extend/augment/build on this dataset, is there a mechanism for them to do so? If so, is there a process for track- ing/assessing the quality of those contributions. What is the process for communicating/distributing these contributions to users?\n",
    "\tUnknown.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## __*Legal & Ethical Considerations:*__\n",
    "\n",
    "### If the dataset relates to people (e.g., their attributes) or was generated by people, were they informed about the data collection? (e.g., datasets that collect writing, photos, interactions, transactions, etc.)\n",
    "\tYes, when an individual self-reports, they give their consent within the survey format that their data will be utilized for research purposes and deidentified to be made available to the public.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### If it relates to other ethically protected subjects, have appropriate obligations been met? \n",
    "\tCDC and FDA are public health authorities as defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information; Final Rule (Privacy Rule) [45 CFR §164.501]. Pursuant to 45 CFR §164.512(b) of the Privacy Rule is applicable to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS). Subjects are thus protected under the HIPPA Privacy Rule. \n",
    "\t\n",
    "### If it relates to people, were they told what the dataset would be used for and did they consent? What community norms exist for data collected from human communications? If consent was obtained, how? Were the people provided with any mechanism to revoke their consent in the future or for certain uses? \n",
    "\tYes, it is transparent what the data will be used for when signing consent. Consent was obtained when subjects submitted their reports on their own. They self-reported and were required to sign off legal disclaimers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### If it relates to people, could this dataset expose people to harm or legal action? (e.g., financial social or otherwise) What was done to mitigate or reduce the potential for harm?\n",
    "\t No. Data is de-identified under HIPPA privacy laws. \n",
    "\n",
    "### If it relates to people, does it unfairly advantage or disadvantage a particular social group? In what ways? How was this mitigated? \n",
    "\tPotentially. Since this is a passive reporting system, marginalized communities might not have access to this database or know that such information is actively being collected. \n",
    "\n",
    "### If it relates to people, were they provided with privacy guarantees? \n",
    "\tYes. HIPPA privacy protection. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Does the dataset comply with the EU General Data Protection Regu- lation (GDPR)? Does it comply with any other standards, such as the US Equal Employment Opportunity Act?\n",
    "\tUnknown. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Does the dataset contain information that might be considered sensitive or confidential? (e.g., personally identifying information)\n",
    "\tYes. Personal demographic and health data information are being collected. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Does the dataset contain information that might be considered inappropriate or offensive?\n",
    "\tNo. \n",
