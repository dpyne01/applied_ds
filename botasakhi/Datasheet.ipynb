    "## *Motivation for Data Creation*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why was the dataset created? (e.g., were there specific tasks in mind, or a specific gap that needed to be filled?)\n",
    "\n",
    "The salary report was created by PayScale to provide its users with a detailed compensation report that compares their compensation to others like them. “Where it Pays to Attend College” was created by the WSJ by extracting some of the data from PayScale’s report to provide information and compare the incomes of certain college graduates (mainly Ivy League) depending on what (major) and where (university) they studied during undergrad. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for? Are there obvious tasks for which it should not be used? \n",
    "Nothing too obvious.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Has the dataset been used for any tasks already? If so, where are the results so others can compare (e.g., links to published papers)? \n",
    "The dataset was somewhat analyzed by the WSJ in Ivy Leaguers’ Big Edge: Starting Pay: https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121746658635199271\n",
    "Also, some of Kaggle users did their own analysis: https://www.kaggle.com/wsj/college-salaries/kernels \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, provide the grant number. \n",
    "There is no mentioning of any funding for this dataset both in the WSJ, PayScale and Kaggle. \n"

    "## *Data Composition*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are the instances? (that is, examples; e.g., documents, images, people, countries) Are there multiple types of instances? (e.g., movies, users, ratings; people, interactions between them; nodes, edges) \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 subsets to the dataset. In total, there are multiple types of instances such as different salaries (starting, mid-career percentiles), colleges (name and type), major, and region. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Are relationships between instances made explicit in the data? \n",
    "There are no known relationships between instances except for the fact that graduate degree holders and self-employed/contract-based employees were excluded from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How many instances of each type are there? \n",
    "There are 50 majors and corresponding salaries; 269 universities and types and corresponding salaries; and 320 universities and region and corresponding salaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data (e.g., unprocessed text or images)? Features/attributes? Is there a label/target associated with instances? If the instances are related to people, are subpopulations identified (e.g., by age, gender, etc.) and what is their distribution? \n",
    "Each instance for the major subset contains associated starting, mid-career, and percentiles mid-career salaries. Same goes for university/type and region instances. The subpopulation data was not available in the WSJ except for the fact that there are no graduate degree holders/self-employed/contract workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Is everything included or does the data rely on external resources? (e.g., websites, tweets, datasets) If external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) is there an official archival version. Are there licenses, fees or rights associated with any of the data? \n",
    "Some of the salaries are missing, and there are some duplicates. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Are there recommended data splits or evaluation measures? (e.g., training, development, testing; accuracy/AUC) \n",
    "The data comes with specified splits (3 subsets) for major, college/type and college/region. The recommended measures are unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What experiments were initially run on this dataset? Have a summary of those results and, if available, provide the link to a paper with more information here. \n",
    "The WSJ’s article can be found here: https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121746658635199271 and it mainly suggests the following:\n",
    "* The median starting salary for Ivy Leaguers is 32% higher than that of liberal-arts college graduates\n",
    "* The incomes of graduates from all types of schools grow almost at the same rate\n",
    "* Salary increase percentage in 10 years is highest for liberal art schools (95%) but lowest for engineering (76%)\n",
    "* It is more about the career path one chooses rather than the major one studied\n",

    "## *Dataset Collection Process*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How was the data collected? (e.g., hardware apparatus/sensor, manual human curation, software pro- gram, software interface/API; how were these con- structs/measures/methods validated?)  \n",
    "The data used in PayScale’s College Salary Report was collected through online compensation survey, where people self-report data about their jobs, compensation, employer, demographics and educational background. However, it is unknown whether the WSJ copied the full dataset or extracted some part of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Who was involved in the data collection process?(e.g., students, crowdworkers) How were they compensated? (e.g., how much were crowdworkers paid?) \n",
    "Anyone who wanted to get PayScale’s compensation report. They were “compensated” with a detailed compensation report that compares their compensation to others like them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Over what time-frame was the data collected? Does the collection time-frame match the creation time-frame? \n",
    "For this dataset unknown. However, PayScale’s survey is ongoing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (e.g., raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (e.g., part of speech tags; model-based guesses for age or language)? If the latter two, were they validated/verified and if so how? \n",
    "The data was reported by individuals (through a survey.) PayScale claims that the data is verified2, but it is unknown how.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Does the dataset contain all possible instances? Or is it, for instance, a sample (not necessarily random) from a larger set of instances? \n",
    "It is a sample from a larger set, aka the dataset does not contain all possible instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### If the dataset is a sample, then what is the population? What was the sampling strategy (e.g., deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)? Is the sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic coverage)? If not, why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range of in- stances)? How does this affect possible uses? \n",
    "PayScale states: “the sample size is 3.2 M. The sample size for each school included ranges from 28 profiles to over 25,000, depending largely upon the size of the school.”2 However, it is unclear what was the sampling strategy used for the WSJ. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Is there information missing from the dataset and why? (this does not include intentionally dropped instances; it might include, e.g., redacted text, withheld documents) Is this data missing because it was unavailable? \n",
    "Unknown. (the WSJ does not provide any explanation)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Are there any known errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the data? \n",
    "Missing data\n"

    "## *Data Preprocessing*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What preprocessing/cleaning was done? (e.g., discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values, etc.) \n",
    "Unknown. (neither the WSJ nor PayScale does not provide any information)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned data? (e.g., to support unanticipated future uses) \n",
    "Unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Is the preprocessing software available? \n",
    "Unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Does this dataset collection/processing procedure achieve the motivation for creating the dataset stated in the first section of this datasheet? \n",
    "Unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Any other comments? \n",
    "PayScale’s core business is building software that utilizes our data and compensation algorithm. The “Where it Pays to Attend College” dataset by the WSJ is based on PayScale data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## *Dataset Distribution*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How is the dataset distributed?  (e.g., website, API, etc.; does the data have a DOI; is it archived redundantly?) \n",
    "The dataset can be downloaded from: http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/info-Salaries_for_Colleges_by_Type-sort.html\n",
    "and from: https://www.kaggle.com/wsj/college-salaries\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When will the dataset be released/first distributed? (Is there a canonical paper/reference for this dataset?) \n",
    "The dataset was released on July 31, 2008 on the WSJ and was updated 2 years ago on Kaggle.\n",
    "#### What license (if any) is it distributed under? Are there any copyrights on the data? \n",
    "Copyrights on the data belong to PayScale.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Are there any fees or access/export restrictions?\n",
    "None. \n",
    "\n",
    "## *Data Maintenance*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Who is supporting/hosting/maintaining the dataset? How does one contact the owner/curator/manager of the dataset (e.g. email address, or other contact info)? \n",
    "The dataset is hosted at the WSJ and all comments can be sent to newseditors@wsj.com\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Will the dataset be updated? How often and by whom? How will updates/revisions be documented and communicated (e.g., mailing list, GitHub)? Is there an erratum? \n",
    "There is a newer dataset available on the PayScale’s website with fewer salary instances, but with the new ones like STEM variables and High Meaning. PayScale seems to produce new college report every year.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### If the dataset becomes obsolete how will this be communicated? \n",
    "Since PayScale’s whole business is built around this report they probably won’t ever claim it as obsolete. However, if more verified similar dataset will be available, this one will become useless.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Is there a repository to link to any/all papers/systems that use this dataset? \n",
    "Unknown. (I could not find one)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### If others want to extend/augment/build on this dataset, is there a mechanism for them to do so? If so, is there a process for tracking/assessing the quality of those contributions. What is the process for communicating/distributing these contributions to users? \n",
    "Since the original collected data is not public and there is no way of accessing those contributions, the only way to build on this dataset is to use external data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## *Legal and Ethical Considerations*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### If the dataset relates to people (e.g., their attributes) or was generated by people, were they informed about the data collection? (e.g., datasets that collect writing, photos, interactions, transactions, etc.) \n",
    "According to PayScale, people willingly self-reported the data.\n",
    "#### If it relates to other ethically protected subjects, have appropriate obligations been met? (e.g., medical data might include information collected from animals)\n",
    "Not applicable\n",
    "#### If it relates to people, were there any ethical review applications/reviews/approvals? (e.g. Institutional Review Board applications) \n",
    "Unknown\n",
    "#### If it relates to people, were they told what the dataset would be used for and did they consent? What community norms exist for data collected from human communications? If consent was obtained, how? Were the people provided with any mechanism to revoke their consent in the future or for certain uses? \n",
    "Since the data was self-reported it implies that people consent.\n",
    "#### If it relates to people, could this dataset expose people to harm or legal action? (e.g., financial social or otherwise) What was done to mitigate or reduce the potential for harm? \n",
    "There is a minimal risk because people provided consent when provided the data.  \n",
    "#### If it relates to people, does it unfairly advantage or dis- advantage a particular social group? In what ways? How was this mitigated? \n",
    "Unknown  \n",
    "#### If it relates to people, were they provided with privacy guarantees? If so, what guarantees and how are these ensured? \n",
    "Unknown\n",
    "#### Does the dataset comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)? Does it comply with any other standards, such as the US Equal Employment Opportunity Act?\n",
    "Probably, https://www.payscale.com/compensation-today/2018/05/gdpr-commitments \n",
    "#### Does the dataset contain information that might be considered sensitive or confidential? (e.g., personally identifying information) \n",
    "Possibly yes.\n",
    "#### Does the dataset contain information that might be considered inappropriate or offensive? \n",
    "Probably no.\n"
