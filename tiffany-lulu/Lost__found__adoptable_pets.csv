My name is Wiley and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by my previous owner on 12/14/18 because I was going to the bathroom outside of the litterbox.  My previous owners said that I do not seem to get along with other cats or dogs, so I may do best as the only cat in my new home. I am an active and friendly cat, and I love to play with string toys.  <p/><p/>My personality color is BLUE in this environment. I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/><p/>Adoption Fee: $30.00<p/>",BLUE

My name is Kingston and I am available for adoption in foster care. <p/><p/>I was brought in by my previous owner on September 20, 2018 because I was not settling into the business of my new home after moving cross country. My previous owner described me as very smart, sweet, gentle, and playful.<p/><p/>I am full of energy and I love to play! I especially love fetch, running, snow, and being outdoors! I also love playing with plushie squeaker toys and playing tug of war! Despite my high energy level, I am very patient. I love to please my people and my foster family says I am truly the definition of ""man's best friend"".<p/><p/>I walk great on leash. I love to be brushed and scratched and will sleep in bed with you in you let me! I am also super curious and will gladly follow you around and be your shadow. Think of me like an adorable assistant!<p/><p/>I am a very smart dog! I have shown my caregivers that I already know how to ""sit"", ""stay"", ""come"", and ""shake"" and I can't wait to learn more! I would do best with some additional positive reinforcement training so that I can learn to relax and trust. I can be a little standoffish at first, but if you give me a little time and patience I will bond with you and love you immensely!<p/><p/>My caregivers have observed that I might not get along with other dogs. I would do best in an adult only home and as the only fur kid in my new home as I do not like to share my people with other dogs and tend to chase cats. I would love to be able to get all your attention!<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality!  I am full of energy and I love to play! I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy.  I would do best in a home without young children.<p/><p/>I am currently spending some time in a foster home. Please call the shelter at 206-296-3936 to learn how to meet me.<p/>Adoption Fee: $125.00<p/>",RED

My name is Ollie and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by my previous owner on February 8th, 2019,  because I lived a very playful dog that liked to chase me. I lived in a home with a large dog, and children.<p/><p/>I'm a very sweet and shy guy who wants to find a loving and quiet environment. Although I lived with a dog, he was a very rambunctious and playful guy who liked to chase me and it was not that fun for me. My favorite activities include snuggling under blankets *especially thick comforters* and hanging out in my persons lap, giving and receiving all the loves and just being around my people. New people can be a little scary for me at first but with some time, I warm up and actually like to get to know them.<p/><p/>My personality color is GREEN. I am an adaptable cat who loves to go with the flow! I am outgoing and carefree, and I just can't wait to find my forever home!<p/><p/><p/>I was previously declawed on my front paws. Because I can't protect myself outside, I need to be an indoor-only cat.<p/><p/><p/> Adoption Fee: $30.00<p/>",

My name is Turbo and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by my previous owner on January 27, 2019 because I was not a good fit for their home.<p/><p/>I am an independent dog who likes to do my own thing!  I can be sensitive to being picked up and handled, so I would do best in a home with older children.  I do like car rides and am able to jump high into the car without needing to be picked up. I am full of energy and like to go for regular walks or play in a wide open space.  <p/><p/>My caregivers have noticed that I seem to do well with other small dogs. When meeting dogs in a new home, I would do best with a slow introduction.<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality!  I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a dog savvy family who understands that I might take some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/> Adoption Fee: $225.00<p/>",RED
