    "#### Motivation for Dataset Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "***Why was the data set created? (e.g., were there specific tasks in mind, or a specific gap that needed to be filled?)*** \n",
    "\n",
    "The data was created by OSMI (Open Sourcing Mental Illness), who conducted a survey seeking information about mental health attitudes in tech organizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "***What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for? Are there obvious tasks for which it should not be used?*** \n",
    "\n",
    "The data can be used for understanding the relationships of mental health attitudes in tech organizations with gender, geography, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Has the dataset been used for any tasks already? If so, where are the results so others can compare (e.g., links to published papers)?***\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has been used by OSMI to create some guidelines, and by individuals on Kaggle to analyze correlations in geography and mental health attitudes. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, provide the grant number.*** \n",
    "\n",
    "There are no grants associated, the dataset was funded by OSMI, where they gain some funding from donations.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Any other comments?*** \n",
    "\n",
    "No\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset Composition \n",
    "\n",
    "***What are the instances? (that is, examples; e.g., documents, images, people, countries) Are there multiple types of instances? (e.g., movies, users, ratings; people, interactions between them; nodes, edges)***\n",
    "\n",
    "Each instance is an individual paired with all of their demographic data and  information about their attitudes and previous experiences. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Are relations between instances made explicit in the data (e.g., social network links, user/movie ratings, etc.)?*** \n",
    "\n",
    "There is no known relations in the data between the individuals or the different variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "***How many instances of each type are there?*** \n",
    "\n",
    "The survey has results from 1,259 individuals without the knowledge of any repeats in the data (people that may have taken the survey more than a single time). \n",
    "\n",
    "***What data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data (e.g., unprocessed text or images)? Features/attributes? Is there a label/target associated with instances? If the instances are related to people, are subpopulations identified (e.g., by age, gender, etc.) and what is their distribution?***\n",
    "\n",
    "Each instance consists of information about the individuals information that includes demographic, geographic, attitude and workplace information. This includes subjective information about the procedures in place for mental health in the workplace and the individuals attitudes towards the workplace procedures surrounding mental health. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Is everything included or does the data rely on external resources? (e.g., websites, tweets, datasets) If external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) is there an official archival version. Are there licenses, fees or rights associated with any of the data?***\n",
    "\n",
    "The particular survey that I am analyzing is from 2014, although there is more information being analyzed from the current year on the OSMI survey. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Are there recommended data splits or evaluation measures? (e.g., training, development, testing; accuracy/AUC)***\n",
    "\n",
    "Unknown \n",
    "\n",
    "***What experiments were initially run on this dataset? Have a summary of those results and, if available, provide the link to a paper with more information here.*** \n",
    "\n",
    "Data on the correlations between the attitudes and the prevalence of mental illness and the recommendations on these can be found on the OSMI website: \n",
    "\n",
    "https://osmihelp.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "***Any other comments?***\n",
    "\n",
    "No\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Collection Process \n",
    "\n",
    "***How was the data collected? (e.g., hardware apparatus/sensor, manual human curation, software program, software interface/API; how were these constructs/measures/methods validated?)***\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was collected through an electronic survey found on the OSMI website. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Who was involved in the data collection process? (e.g., students, crowdworkers) How were they compensated? (e.g., how much were crowdworkers paid?)*** \n",
    "\n",
    "Individuals that currently work in the tech industry were asked to take the survey. Unknown if they were compensated and if anyone processed the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Over what time-frame was the data collected? Does the collection time-frame match the creation time-frame?*** \n",
    "\n",
    "Data was collected from 8/27/14 to 2/1/16 where the majority of the data is collected in 2014 (1191 instances)\n",
    "\n",
    "***How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (e.g., raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (e.g., part of speech tags; model-based guesses for age or language)? If the latter two, were they validated/verified and if so how?*** \n",
    "\n",
    "The data was reported by the subjects directly though a survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Does the dataset contain all possible instances? Or is it, for instance, a sample (not necessarily random) from a larger set of instances?*** \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset does not contain all possible instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "***If the dataset is a sample, then what is the population? What was the sampling strategy (e.g., deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)? Is the sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic coverage)? If not, why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range of instances)? How does this affect possible uses?*** \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is a sample of individuals in the tech industry in a variety of different countries and of different genders. However, from first glance, it can be observed that 60% of the individuals who took the survey are from the U.S. and ~80% of the individuals who took the survey are male.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Is there information missing from the dataset and why? (this does not include intentionally dropped instances; it might include, e.g., redacted text, withheld documents) Is this data missing because it was unavailable?*** \n",
    "\n",
    "Unknown \n",
    "\n",
    "***Are there any known errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the data?*** \n",
    "\n",
    "From looking at the data, it can be seen that there are various different issues such as the fact that there are different capitalizations/versions of the genders, e.g. M, Male, male, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Any other comments?***\n",
    "\n",
    "No\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "***What preprocessing/cleaning was done? (e.g., discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values, etc.)*** \n",
    "\n",
    "Unknown \n",
    "\n",
    "***Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned data? (e.g., to support unanticipated future uses)***\n",
    "\n",
    "The data accessed is the raw data. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Is the preprocessing software available? ***\n",
    "\n",
    "N/A.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Does this dataset collection/processing procedure achieve the motivation for creating the dataset stated in the first section of this datasheet? ***\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, the individuals who created the survey wanted to observe the general attitudes on mental health in tech organizations, and since the majority of the individuals who took the survey work in tech (82%), the attitudes can be observed. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Any other comments?***\n",
    "\n",
    "No\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset Distribution \n",
    "\n",
    "***How is the dataset distributed? (e.g., website, API, etc.; does the data have a DOI; is it archived redundantly?)*** \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey/version/3 or https://osmihelp.org/research. \n",
    "\n",
    "***When will the dataset be released/first distributed? (Is there a canonical paper/reference for this dataset?)*** \n",
    "\n",
    "The exact date is unknown, but the data was published in 2016 on Kaggle. \n",
    "\n",
    "***What license (if any) is it distributed under? Are there any copyrights on the data?***\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Through email : info@osmihelp.org or via twitter or Facebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Will the dataset be updated? How often and by whom? How will updates/revisions be documented and communicated (e.g., mailing list, GitHub)? Is there an erratum?***\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset will not be updated as the time frame has passed; however, there are surveys for more recent years that are ongoing. \n",
    "\n",
    "***If the dataset becomes obsolete how will this be communicated?*** \n",

    "\n",
    "There are likely others, but I was unable to find many more. \n",
    "\n",
    "***If others want to extend/augment/build on this dataset, is there a mechanism for them to do so? If so, is there a process for tracking/assessing the quality of those contributions. What is the process for communicating/distributing these contributions to users?*** \n",

    "#### Legal & Ethical Considerations \n",
    "\n",
    "***If the dataset relates to people (e.g., their attributes) or was generated by people, were they informed about the data collection? (e.g., datasets that collect writing, photos, interactions, transactions, etc.)*** \n",
    "\n",
    "The data involves information about individuals and their attitudes; however, the data is public and does not include any names or identifying information.  \n",
    "\n",
    "***If it relates to other ethically protected subjects, have appropriate obligations been met? (e.g., medical data might include information collected from animals)*** \n",
    "\n",
    "N/A\n",
    "\n",
    "***If it relates to people, were there any ethical review applications/reviews/approvals? (e.g. Institutional Review Board applications)*** \n",
    "\n",
    "N/A. \n",
    "\n",
    "***If it relates to people, were they told what the dataset would be used for and did they consent? What community norms exist for data collected from human communications? If consent was obtained, how? Were the people provided with any mechanism to revoke their consent in the future or for certain uses?***\n",
    "\n",
    "Unknown because I could not access the survey. \n",
    "\n",
    "***If it relates to people, could this dataset expose people to harm or legal action? (e.g., financial social or otherwise) What was done to mitigate or reduce the potential for harm? ***\n",
